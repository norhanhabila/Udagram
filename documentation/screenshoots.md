My AWS account is locked and the udacity team is working to get it fixed so I couldn't get my screenshoots

-I made the RDS database and it's tested by postbird and connected perfectly
-S3 frontend bucket shows the application interface
-Elastic beanstalk environment was also healthy
-The pipeline was working until my AWS account was locked so I get the error not authorized access :(
